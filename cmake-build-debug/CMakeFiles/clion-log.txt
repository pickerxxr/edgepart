CMake Deprecation Warning at CMakeLists.txt:1 (cmake_minimum_required):
  Compatibility with CMake < 2.8.12 will be removed from a future version of
  CMake.

  Update the VERSION argument <min> value or use a ...<max> suffix to tell
  CMake that the project does not need compatibility with older versions.


CMake Error at /Applications/CLion.app/Contents/bin/cmake/mac/share/cmake-3.20/Modules/CMakeFindDependencyMacro.cmake:47 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "gflags" (requested
  version 2.2.2) with any of the following names:

    gflagsConfig.cmake
    gflags-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "gflags" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "gflags_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "gflags"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
